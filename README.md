# FLO Retailing Customer Segmentation with RFM

FLO Retailing, which exports to Pakistan, Macedonia, Oman, Iran, Turkmenistan and Bulgaria with the shoes brands within its organization, produces 120 thousand pairs of soles daily at the sole factory it owns and exports to many countries such as France, Italy, Portugal, Russia, Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria, Jordan, Palestine, Egypt, Algeria and Morocco as well as meeting the demand of the Turkish market.
Offering employment to more than 7 thousand individuals directly and almost 30,000 indirectly, FLO Retailing accomplishes the production of more than 3 million 500 thousand pairs of shoes and the sales of 35 million pairs of shoes per year.
